            <div class="behavior-item">
                <h3>‚Ä¢ Asking for money</h3>
                <p>Scammers often request money for medical bills, travel expenses, or other excuses.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="behavior-item">
                <h3>‚Ä¢ Rushing the relationship</h3>
                <p>If someone professes deep feelings or tries to move things forward too quickly, it's a potential red flag.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="behavior-item">
                <h3>‚Ä¢ Avoiding real meetings or video calls</h3>
                <p>A match who refuses to meet in person or have a video chat may be hiding their true identity.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="behavior-item">
                <h3>‚Ä¢ Dodging questions</h3>
                <p>If your match avoids answering your questions but bombards you with their own, they might be trying to steal your identity, access your passwords, passphrases, or other security information.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="behavior-item">
                <h3>‚Ä¢ Requesting personal information</h3>

            </div>

            <div class="behavior-item">
                <h3>‚Ä¢ Suggestion to follow a link</h3>
                <p>If someone you're chatting with sends you a link and insists on you following it, it could be an attempt to steal your data or infect your device with malware.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="behavior-item">
                <h3>‚Ä¢ Fake verification requests</h3>
